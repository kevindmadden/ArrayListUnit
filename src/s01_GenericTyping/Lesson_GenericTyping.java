    Task #1:
    Write a new class called ValuePrinterStrings as follows:
    1. Declare two private instance variables called **arr** whose type is a 1D String array.
    2. Write a constructor that accepts a single parameter and stores it in the instance variable **arr**.
    3. Write a method called **printArr**. This method should use a for-each loop to print out the contents of **arr**.

    be called ArrayPrinterIntegers and work for 1D int arrays rather than 1D String arrays.

    This single class should have the same functionality as the three different classes created in Tasks #1-3.

    Q&A
    1. Do I need to be able to write my own classes on the AP exam that use generic types?
            No. However, you need to be able to use the ArrayList class, which uses generic typing.
    2. What is the purpose of these exercises?
            a. To show you why generic types are useful.
            b. The ArrayList class (the topic of the unit) uses generic typing. So you DO need to be able
            to use classes on the AP Exam that use generic typing. This should be more straightforward once
            you see what is going on behind the scenes to make generic typing work.
    3. Can I think of a generic type as a variable that stores a type rather than a value?
            Yes.
